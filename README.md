# WP Store Locator: Co-Authors

Wordpress Plugin that creates a new user role called `Store Locator: Co-Author` with extremely limited permissions tailored to editing a single Store Locator location on which they are co-author. 
Designed to solve the use-case of allowing individual store employees to have a unique account and permission to author the metadata for their location while restricting access to the rest of the site.

## Usage
- Install and Activate the plugin
- Give a user the `Store Locator: Co-Author` role
- Set that user as Co-Author on the desired Store Location(s).
